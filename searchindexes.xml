There are a lot of tools for doing personal blog. You can choose any one or even build it by yourself. I decided move forward with static site solution, like many ather developers. Reading this article you can get more about building personal blog, static-site, theme, Hugo, NexT. Static site and Hugo Hugo Github Hugo Hugo quick start Theme template for Hugo Other problem is to chose template theme. There are a douse-nt of variants hugo themes . I take one Hugo theme next and Hugo theme next starter as a current starter.
Deployment and GitHub Pages No cost option is to use public free hosting GitHub Pages. Benefits are:
It is a code repository with version control It can be as hosting GitHub Pages It has pipline aka GitHub Actions It has ready to use solution like Hugo hosting on GitHub My site is published to these domains
ego.github.io ego.systemdef.com Setup custom subdomain
About custom domains and GitHub Pages Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site I do some customisations for theme and created helpers scripts for release.
These website will be mostly for my personal usage as a place for information of different topics. But mostly I will post engineering staff.
Have fun 😆,

Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you enjoy reading about my experiences and insights in the world of software engineering .
Software engineering As a results-driven software engineer with over 15 years of focused experience, I have a proven track record of delivering robust production code for high-volume businesses across various industries, including e-commerce and large retailers, game development , VoIP telecommunications, and web-based scalable services and systems .

Soft skills From my point of view, I can say, that I sophisticated problem solver and enthusiastic team player. My coworkers know me as a deeply critical thinker who believes in logic and deductive reasoning .
Work and life My main work is related to developing software systems , the computation , and the mass-users serving over World Wide Web (WWW), Internet . So my focus is on related to software engineering topics, scalable and distributed systems, data engineering, cloud computing and so on.
I have a passion for finding efficient and simple solutions to real-world problems , and understand the importance of balancing good code quality with timely results. Throughout my career, I have spent a lot of my time leading teams, and I am proud of the results that my teams have been able to achieve. I take pride in my ability to make wise technology and architecture choices on a consistent basis.
I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. Albert Einstein I am passionate about programming languages and researching, and constantly seek out new ideas and solutions. I easily generate new ideas, possibilities, and design elegant solutions.
I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Albert Einstein I am always striving to improve my skills and knowledge in order to stay ahead of the World curve and be the best software engineer I can be.

# Software engineering

As a results-driven [**software engineer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) 
with over 15 years of focused experience, I have a proven track record of delivering 
robust production code for high-volume businesses across various industries, 
including [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce) and large retailers, [game development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development), 
[VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) telecommunications, and [web-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) [scalable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability) services and [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System). 
I have also worked with different parts of over [Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), for both the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) and [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) markets.


# Education
My professional journey began at the university, 
where I received a relevant education and obtained a master's degree.

# Soft skills
From my point of view, I can say, that I [sophisticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom) problem solver and enthusiastic team player.
My coworkers know me as a deeply [critical thinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking) who believes in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)

# Work and life
My main work is related to developing [**software systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system), the [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), 
and the mass-users serving over [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) (WWW), [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). So my focus is on related to 
software engineering topics, scalable and distributed systems, data engineering, streaming, [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) and so on.

I have a passion for finding efficient and simple solutions to real-world [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving), 
and understand the importance of balancing good [code quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality) with timely results. 
Throughout my career, I have spent a lot of my time leading teams, 
and I am proud of the results that my teams have been able to achieve. 
I take pride in my ability to make wise [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) and [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) choices on a consistent basis.

I am passionate about programming languages and researching, 
and constantly seek out new ideas and solutions.
I easily generate new ideas, possibilities, and design elegant solutions.

> I believe in intuition and inspiration.

Place to keep and organize greate courses for software developers.
Based on my own. [Previous posts](/post/engineering/blogs.html)

Every developer, programmer or engineer should have main wide common specializations
aka Python developer. Also, specific one and/or two areas of knowledge could make you better.
Additional knowledge and advanced skills in something very tiny, rare, and valuable in the since space.

0. Software Engineer - Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) technologies 
1. DevOps Engineer - Infrastructure, scale, reliability, cloud 
3. Data Engineer - BigData, Data lake, data streaming, and analytics
4. DevOps ML/AI Engineer - AIOps, MLOps
4. Software Systems Architect - System design and distributed systems 


<img src="/post/courses/software-engineering-courses-c.png" alt="software engineering courses" width="500" />


So, I can divide all onto these spaces 

- Application space 
- System space
- Distributed and high scalability spaces 
- Cloud spaces
- Data/ML/AI space
- Software architecture and design


Main topics which has value for me:

- DevOps
- AIOps
- MLOps
- AWS Cloud
- Google Cloud
- Distributed systems

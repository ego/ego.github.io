After all, my blog has been released!
{{< /quote >}}

<a href="/post/blog-hello-world.html">
There are a lot of tools for doing personal blog.
You can choose any one or even build it by yourself.
I decided move forward with static site solution, like many ather developers.
Reading this article you can get more about building personal blog, static-site, theme, Hugo, NexT.

## Static site and Hugo

  * [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
  * [Github Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
  * [Hugo quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

## Theme template for Hugo
Other problem is to chose template theme.
There are a douse-nt of variants [hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io).
I take one [Hugo theme next](https://github.com/hugo-next/hugo-theme-next)
and [Hugo theme next starter](https://github.com/hugo-next/hugo-theme-next-starter) as a current starter.


## Deployment and GitHub Pages
No cost option is to use public free hosting GitHub Pages.
Benefits are:
* It is a code repository with version control
* It can be as hosting [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* It has pipline aka GitHub Actions
* It has ready to use solution like [Hugo hosting on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

My site is published to these domains

* [ego.github.io](https://ego.github.io)
* [ego.systemdef.com](https://ego.systemdef.com)

Setup custom subdomain

* [About custom domains and GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)
* [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain)

I do some customisations for theme and created helpers scripts for release.

These website will be mostly for my personal usage 
as a place for information of different topics.
But mostly I will post engineering staff.
